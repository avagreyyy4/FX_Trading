## Overview

The objective of this project was to design, implement, and compare trading algorithms using both traditional time-series techniques and modern machine learning methods for the EUR/GBP exchange rate. The first method employed an exponential smoothing trend-following strategy. This strategy aimed to identify optimal $\alpha$ and $\beta$, develop effective trading rules, and evaluate their predictive performance.

The second strategy implemented a neural-network-based machine learning approach to identify profitable profit-taking opportunities. The goal of this strategy was to determine an optimal profit-taking value, an optimal probability threshold, and the number of historical days the model should learn from.

The goal of this project was not only to evaluate whether these strategies
were profitable, but also to assess their performance and limitations. This report will explore both techniques, outlining methodology, modeling, analysis, interpretation, and limitations.
